# INST377 - Final Project

# Air Quality Tracker
### By Joshua Balagtas, Maya Mistry

# Description:
### For our project, we would like to introduce our Air Quality Tracker, which aims to address and serve the growing issues of air pollution and the lack of real-time information about your local air quality. Many individuals everywhere have underlying conditions that can be affected by their local air quality, possibly making it a health hazard, on the other hand, there are many outdoor enthusiasts and planners that would also need reliable data and information about their local air quality. Our web application will provide that real-time data, in order to benefit many different kinds of people and provide them with the right information about their area, covering over 1,000 cities using the Air Quality Programmic API.

# Target Browsers/Applications:
### Our web application is designed to be accessible on all major modern browsers across multiple platforms, including Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. It will also be fully responsive and optimized for both iOS and Android devices.
